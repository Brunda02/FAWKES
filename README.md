# FAWKES
A powerful tool designed to cloak images effectively, rendering them unrecognizable to facial recognition algorithms, while still maintaining visual similarity to the original. We have investigated various techniques, such as Eigen Faces, Vision Transformers, MagFace Extractor, and CycleGAN + FaceNet, to break and counter face recognition methods.
